Shows on a map where movies have been filmed in SF

The application is available at [sf-movies.mudit.xyz](http://sf-movies.mudit.xyz).

If it doesn't give any results that means the app has probably crossed the google geocoding quote for the day. If that occurs, ping me and I shall add a fresh key which should give us another 2500 geocoding requests for the day.

The stack I have used is node at the back, a simple in memory db that I wrote, expressjs as the web framework and reactjs in the front.

I have used mocha and shouldjs for testing.

The only boilerplate the codebase contained was what was generated by express-generator but most of that has been overwritten by my changes.

The only boilerplate stuff I haven't touched and is sitting in `bin/www`.
